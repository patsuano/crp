<h4>With its release date being 2003(South Korea) and 2005(USA), this isn't a very old movie, but I already consider it a classic.
Oldboy is a movie I find to be overlooked by many here in the states, porbably because of its origins, as it was made in South
Korea and the only way I found out about it was through one of the world's most renowned film critics, the late Roger Ebert. In 
the following pages I will showcase as much useful information as I can find about the movie, such information will include:</h4>
