<td>Oldboy</br>
With its release date being 2003(South Korea) and 2005(USA), this isn't a very old movie, but I already consider it a classic.
Oldboy is a movie I find to be overlooked by many here in the states, porbably because of its origins, as it was made in South Korea
and the only way I found out about it was through one of the world's most renowned film critics, the late Roger Ebert. In the following
pages I will showcase as much useful information as I can find about the movie, such information will include:
<ul>
<li><a href="p1.htm>lWhat did the movie conribute to the industry.</a></li>
<li><a href="p2.htm>What do others think of the movie.</a></li>
<li><a href="p3.htm>Personal mini-review of the movie</a></li>
