  <h1>What did the movie conribute to the industry?</h1>

I will now talk about the technical beauty of Oldboy, as I believe the movie makes impressive use of many genres at once while making
old cliches of those genres seem entertaining again.</br>
One good example is a fighting scene between Oh Dae-su and a whole bunch of men in a very closed corridor. A very old element of movies
(mostly Asian, from my experience) is the 1 v. 100 fight. Back then I saw it more as a simple way of saying, "this guy's really strong"
but in Oldboy I feel it's less than that, and more of, look how crazy this guy goes in order to achieve his goal, and how ridiculously
the movie does things. Here is a gif of the fight â†’</br></br></br>After that fight there is a pretty good cliche, like those that don't
get old, it's when you treat your story to some tragedy after something good has happened, effectively putting your characters down and
making their actions seem unnecessary and futile(for whatever purpose they were to achieve). The obvious giveaway for the cliche is our
second image, and what follows:

<img src="ob_serious.jpg" onmouseover="mouseOver()" onmouseout="mouseOut()" alt="His victory face.">
