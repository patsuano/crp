I will now talk about the technical beauty of Oldboy, as I believe the movie makes impressive use of many genres at once while making
old cliches of those genres seem entertaining again.</br>
One good example is a fighting scene between Oh Dae-su and a whole bunch of men in a very closed corridor. A very old element of movies
(mostly Asian, from my experience) is the 1 v. 100 fight. Back then I saw it more as a simple way of saying, "this guy's really strong"
but in Oldboy I feel it's less than that, and more of, look how crazy this guy goes in order to achieve his goal, and how ridiculously
the movie does things. Here is a gif of the fight â†’
